# Planner

A minimalistic daily planner and to-do list designed for personal use. Inspired by the Tweek app, I used to like it but it didn't fit all my needs, so I made my own app.

## Project Overview

Planner is a simple, minimalistic tool for managing daily tasks and planning your week. It offers a simple weekly view, allowing you to easily add, delete, reorder, and complete tasks. You can move tasks between days, set repeating tasks with customizable colors, and use a dropdown calendar for selecting specific dates. The app is also installable as a PWA, providing offline access and a native-like experience.

## Features

- **Weekly View:** Plan your week ahead with a clean, simple layout.
- **Task Management:** Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
- **Reordering Tasks:** Drag-and-drop tasks within the same day or move them to other days.
- **Dropdown Calendar:** Quickly select a specific date.
- **Repeating Tasks:** Set tasks to repeat daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly.
- **Task Colors:** Mark tasks with one of 12 available colors for better organization.
- **PWA Support:** Install the app for offline access and a native-like experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Zustand
- **Backend:** Firebase (Database, Authentication)
- **Drag-and-Drop:** @hello-pangea/dnd
